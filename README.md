# Jarvis
- Now we have "clean" project structure, wake word functional and also much more knowledge about audio..
- Also we now have our "stable text" implementation as a service and it's connected to our transcribtion module. Now what I'm doing is finding a way to feed it to the AI model and how to make it fast


# Future Ideas
## It's block, where I'm writing all ideas that I'll probably add for Jarvis in the future.
- Full control on my Spotify: He would act like my music assistant, I want to give him tools for that and also context to understand my music taste, so something like "Hey Jarvis, I want to listen to some calm music" would be real.
- Weather and Google maps access. I want him to be like and real assistant, so he must understand what the weather is outside or what it'll be in few days. The same is with trafic.
- Brainshtorming sessions: I want for him to make a separeted context sessions specially for some topics, and then to move freely between them. So for example I can discuss with him some project and then after few weeks move back to this discussion and he'll have perfect context about it.
- Smart home controls: Now I'm learning electronics and arduino stuff, so it would be good to mix it up with Jarvis, so something like "Hey Jarvis, turn on the lights" would be real
- Coding skills: Of course I understand that local AI model would be terrible at coding, but I think Jarvis would be pretty good for promt engineering. I want to give him access to the chatgpt codex, so he'll be able to give promts for this. Ai that drives Ai, crazy hahahah.
- News access: must be pretty easy, just connect him to the news api.
