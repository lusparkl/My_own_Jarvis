# Jarvis
- Now we have almost everything that we need for Jarvis, now I need to put it all together. I need to work on our bot memorizing our convos, so he'll be like real Jarvis. And last thing is how to end conversations, I don't want to do it on keyword cuz it's either some frequently usable or some cringe word, may be I'll make it as a tool, so Jarvis will end them by himself, or end them after 30 seconds of silence.
- After everything that I wrote higher will come true I'll put all parts together and start on preparing for shiping this 0.1 version, but after this there will be tons of work on modifying it, so this project will be really long term.

# Future Ideas
## It's block, where I'm writing all ideas that I'll probably add for Jarvis in the future.
- Full control on my Spotify: He would act like my music assistant, I want to give him tools for that and also context to understand my music taste, so something like "Hey Jarvis, I want to listen to some calm music" would be real.
- Weather and Google maps access. I want him to be like and real assistant, so he must understand what the weather is outside or what it'll be in few days. The same is with trafic.
- Brainshtorming sessions: I want for him to make a separeted context sessions specially for some topics, and then to move freely between them. So for example I can discuss with him some project and then after few weeks move back to this discussion and he'll have perfect context about it.
- Smart home controls: Now I'm learning electronics and arduino stuff, so it would be good to mix it up with Jarvis, so something like "Hey Jarvis, turn on the lights" would be real
- Coding skills: Of course I understand that local AI model would be terrible at coding, but I think Jarvis would be pretty good for promt engineering. I want to give him access to the chatgpt codex, so he'll be able to give promts for this. Ai that drives Ai, crazy hahahah.
- News access: must be pretty easy, just connect him to the news api.
